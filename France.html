                                <p>It's wonderful to have generous friends. Especially when they own a house in the south of France and invite you to use it anytime you like!
                                    We stayed in the small village of Boutenac, a short drive from the Pyrenees Mountains.  It's an idyllic French village filled with historic stone houses, surrounded by vineyards.  The village had at most 500 residents and not much else.  Except, it did have it's own biker bar.  Le Bounty was a motorcycle repair shop/bar and restaurant.  
                                    As you walk in, you step over tools and motorcycle parts to get to the bar.  Harley Davidson was the motorcycle of choice (of course).

                                <p>Le Bounty attracted people from all parts of the world</p>

                                <p>It was hard to tell if most of their business was bar or repair shop</p>
