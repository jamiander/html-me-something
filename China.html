                                <p>What a life changing experience!  I like to find unique experiences wherever I travel.  In Beijing, my husband and I decided to stay in the section of the city called the Hutong.  This is old Beijing.  It is made up of courtyard houses, houses several generations of families under one roof, often without electricity or plumbing.  Luckily, we found a courtyard house that had been converted into a lovely inn with some modern amenities.</p>

                                <p>Another great adventure was our tour of the Great Wall of China.  Obviously, a must see!  We hired a guide to take us to a remote section of the wall, a part that has not been rebuilt and is very hard to traverse.  Along the way, we were treated to a homecooked meal at a family home.  We then tented at the wall after hours of climbing the sometimes impassable, crumbling structure. </p>
